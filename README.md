# Module 2: Basics of AI Development

**Summary:**

This module delves into LLMs and prompt engineering, providing foundational knowledge essential for AI development with JavaScript.

Imagine a world where your web applications not only respond to user inputs but also understand and interact in a way that feels almost human. This is the world of AI, where Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT, Mixtral, and Claude have started a revolution. In this module, we're going to dive into the basics of AI development, focusing on how these powerful models can be integrated with JavaScript to create dynamic and intelligent web applications.

## Introduction to LLMs

Large Language Models represent a remarkable leap in the field of AI, offering capabilities that span various modalities, including text, vision, audio, and multimodal (a combination of different types). These models, such as OpenAI's GPT series, Google's BERT, and newer models like Mixtral and Claude, learn to understand context, generate human-like text, and even answer complex questions by being trained on vast datasets, enabling them to perform a wide array of language-related tasks. 

1. **Text-Based Models**: Models like OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) series, including the latest iteration, GPT-3, specialize in understanding and generating human-like text. They are trained on vast datasets of text and can perform tasks like translation, summarization, and content generation.
2. **Vision-Based Models**: These models are designed to understand and interpret visual data. For instance, Google's Vision AI uses machine learning to recognize thousands of objects, such as animals, landmarks, and products, in images.
3. **Audio Models**: Audio models are adept at processing and understanding sound data. Whisper, for example, is an automatic speech recognition system that can transcribe and translate speech across multiple languages.
4. **Multimodal Models**: A multimodal LLM is **a type of AI that's trained with multiple types of data**. It's a subset of AI and is similar to Generative AI (GenAI). Multimodal LLM, like Apple’s Ferret, combines various types of data, such as image, text, speech, and numerical data, with multiple intelligence processing algorithms. This can help multimodal AI perform better than single-modal AI in many real-world problems.

### Getting Started with OpenAI and Node.js

Before diving into the code, make sure you have Node.js installed. If you don't have it, please refer to the first module.

**Step 1: Initialize Your Node.js Project**

1. Create a new directory for your project.
2. Navigate to this directory in your terminal and run **`npm init -y`** to initialize a new Node.js project.
3. Install the OpenAI npm package with **`npm install --save openai`**.

**Step 2: Setting Up OpenAI API**

1. Sign up for an API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/signup). This key is essential to authenticate your requests.
2. Store your API key in a safe place. It’s recommended to use environment variables to keep your key secure.

### Writing the AI Content Generator

Now, let's get to the exciting part – coding our AI content generator.

**Step 3: Configure OpenAI API in Your Application**

Create a new JavaScript file (e.g., **`app.js`**) in your project directory and start by importing the OpenAI library:

```jsx
import OpenAI from "openai";
//const { OpenAI } = require('openai'); (use this if you're getting Warning: To load an ES module, set "type": "module" in the package.json or use the .mjs extension.)

const openai = new OpenAI({
    apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
    dangerouslyAllowBrowser: true,
});
```

Make sure you have set your **`OPENAI_API_KEY`** in your environment variables.

**Step 4: Writing the Function to Generate Content**

Next, we'll write a function that uses OpenAI's SDK **`chat.completions.create`** method to generate content:

```jsx
async function generateContent(prompt) {
    try {
        const chatCompletion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
            messages: [{ role: "user", content: prompt }],
            model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
        });

        return chatCompletion.choices[0].message.content;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error generating content:", error);
        return null;
    }
}
```

In this function, the **`prompt`** is the input from the user, which we send to the OpenAI generative AI model API. The API then returns the generated content based on this prompt.

**Step 5: Testing Your Application**

Now it’s time to test your application. You can do this by adding a simple call to **`generateContent`** at the end of your **`app.js`**:

```jsx
const blogPostPrompt = "Write a comprehensive blog post about the latest trends in blockchain technology for 2024.";

generateContent(blogPostPrompt)
    .then(content => console.log(content))
    .catch(error => console.error(error));
```

Run your application using **`node app.js`** and see the AI-generated content in your console.

- **Full Code**
    
    ```jsx
    import OpenAI from "openai";
    //const { OpenAI } = require('openai'); (use this if you're getting Warning: To load an ES module, set "type": "module" in the package.json or use the .mjs extension.)
    
    const openai = new OpenAI({
        apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
        dangerouslyAllowBrowser: true,
    });
    async function generateContent(prompt) {
        try {
            const chatCompletion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
                messages: [{ role: "user", content: prompt }],
                model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
            });
    
            return chatCompletion.choices[0].message.content;
        } catch (error) {
            console.error("Error generating content:", error);
            return null;
        }
    }
    const blogPostPrompt = "Write a comprehensive blog post about the latest trends in blockchain technology for 2024.";
    
    generateContent(blogPostPrompt)
        .then(content => console.log(content))
        .catch(error => console.error(error));
    ```

For example, instead of using the Mistral client SDK as we did in module 2, we can interact with the chat completions endpoint using [Node.js native `fetch` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) to create our AI content generator as shown below:

```jsx
require('dotenv').config(); //install dotenv

const MISTRAL_API_URL = "https://api.mistral.ai/v1/chat/completions";
const apiKey = process.env.MISTRAL_API_KEY; // Ensure this is set in your .env file or environment

async function generateContent(prompt) {
    const requestBody = {
        model: 'mistral-tiny',
        messages: [{ role: 'user', content: prompt }]
    };

    try {
        const response = await fetch(MISTRAL_API_URL, {
            method: 'POST',
            headers: {
                'Content-Type': 'application/json',
                'Accept': 'application/json',
                'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}`
            },
            body: JSON.stringify(requestBody)
        });

        const data = await response.json();
        return data.choices[0].message.content;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error:', error);
        return null;
    }
}

// Using the blog post prompt
const blogPostPrompt = "Who is the most renowned French painter?";

generateContent(blogPostPrompt)
    .then(content => console.log(content))
    .catch(error => console.error(error));

## Handling AI Model Responses and Interactivity

Effectively managing responses from AI models is crucial. This involves parsing the data returned by the models, error handling, and creating interactive interfaces that can showcase the AI's capabilities in a user-friendly manner. Below is a code snippet that parses the data returned, handles errors, and returns the resulting response in a simple yet effective manner. In future examples and projects, we will show how to create interactive UIs in a way that communicates the AI responses to the user. 

## Project: Build an Image Generation App Using Dall-E Integration

This blog post will guide you through setting up a simple React application using Vite, integrating OpenAI's Dall-E API to generate images, and displaying them using a form-based UI.

<aside>
💡 We will be using OpenAI Documentation on Image Generation: [https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/images/create](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/images/create)

</aside>

### Setting Up the Project

1. **Initialize a Vite + React Project**:
    - Ensure you have Node.js installed.
    - Create a new Vite project with React by running **`npm init vite@latest my-dall-e-app -- --template react`**.
    - Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies: **`cd my-dall-e-app && npm install`**.
    - Start the development server: **`npm run dev`**.
2. **Install OpenAI SDK**:
    - In your project directory, install the OpenAI SDK: **`npm install openai`**.
    - Remember to add your OpenAI API key to a **`.env.local`** file as **`REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`**.

### Building the React Frontend

1. **Modify `App.jsx`**:
    - Replace the existing code in **`App.jsx`** with the following to create a form-based UI for image generation:
    
    ```jsx
    import React, { useState } from 'react';
    import OpenAI from 'openai';
    
    function App() {
      const [prompt, setPrompt] = useState('');
      const [imageUrl, setImageUrl] = useState('');
      const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);
    
      const generateImage = async (promptText) => {
        setIsLoading(true);
        try {
          const apiKey = process.env.REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY; // Ensure the API key is set in your environment variables
          const openai = new OpenAI({
            apiKey: apiKey
          });
          const response = await openai.images.generate({
            model: 'dall-e-3',
            prompt: promptText,
          });
    
          setImageUrl(response.data[0].url);
        } catch (error) {
          console.error('Error:', error);
        } finally {
          setIsLoading(false);
        }
      };
    
      const handleSubmit = (e) => {
        e.preventDefault();
        if (prompt) {
          generateImage(prompt);
        }
      };
    
      return (
        <>
          <h1>Dall-E Image Generator</h1>
          <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
            <input
              type="text"
              value={prompt}
              onChange={(e) => setPrompt(e.target.value)}
              placeholder="Enter a prompt for Dall-E"
            />
            <button type="submit" disabled={isLoading}>
              {isLoading ? 'Generating...': 'Generate Image'}
            </button>
          </form>
          {imageUrl && <img src={imageUrl} alt="Generated from Dall-E" style={{ marginTop: '20px' }} />}
        </>
      );
    }
    
    export default App;
    ```
    
    <aside>
    💡 Note that the button text changes based on the API response status so we can inform the user of what’s going on.
    `{isLoading ? 'Generating...' : 'Generate Image'}`
    
    </aside>
    
- **API Endpoint Alternative**
    
    Alternatively, instead of using the SDK, you can also decide to query the API endpoint using the native `fetch` API as shown below:
    
    ```jsx
    const response = await fetch(
            'https://api.openai.com/v1/images/generations',
            {
              method: 'POST',
              headers: {
                'Content-Type': 'application/json',
                Authorization: `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
              },
              body: JSON.stringify({
                model: 'dall-e-3',
                prompt: promptText,
                n: 1,
                size: '1024x1024',
    	      }),
        }
      );
    
      const data = await response.json();
      setImageUrl(data.data[0].url);
    ```
    
- **Bonus: AI Voice App**
    
    If you’re interested in building a text-to-speech or speech-to-text-app app, use the newly gained knowledge and apply it in integrating OpenAI’s Audio models.
    [https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-to-speech](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-to-speech)
    
1. **Run and Test Your Application**:
    - Start your application: **`npm run dev`**. You should have something like the screenshot below:
        
       ![image](https://github.com/thestriver/ai-for-javascript-course/assets/16709708/f8283dc5-7ba7-407d-8cfb-dd85525c17ca)

    - Visit the local development server URL (usually **`http://localhost:3000`**).
    - Try entering different prompts to generate images and, of course, style them using your preferred CSS setup.

With these steps, you've successfully built an image generation application using OpenAI's Dall-E and React. This application demonstrates the power of AI in creative endeavors and how easily it can be integrated into modern web applications.

## **Conclusion**

# Module 4: Introduction to Retrieval Augmented Generation

Imagine a world where AI not only understands and generates text but also embarks on a quest for knowledge, seeking information from vast data oceans to enlighten its responses. This is the world of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) - a realm where AI models are no longer confined to their training data but can dynamically retrieve and utilize external information. 

In this module, we will explore the intricacies of RAG, understand the role of embeddings and vector databases, and learn about tools that facilitate the development of RAG applications. By the end of this module, you will be equipped to build a research assistant tool using Next.js, harnessing the power of RAG.

## Basics of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

Retrieval Augmented Generation is a technique where a generative model, like GPT-3.5, is combined with an external knowledge retrieval step in a way that improves the accuracy and reliability of the model’s responses. This hybrid approach allows the model to pull in relevant information in real-time, enhancing its responses or generation with details far beyond its training data.

### **How RAG Works**

RAG operates in two steps. 

**Retrieval:**
First, a query is used to retrieve relevant information from (multiple) documents or data from a large dataset. 
**Content generation:**

Then, this retrieved data is combined with the query to generate a response. This process ensures that the responses are not just based on learned patterns but are also informed by specific, up-to-date, and relevant external data.

## Understanding Embeddings and Vector Databases

To understand RAG, one must grasp the concept of embeddings and vector databases.

- **Embeddings:** In AI, embeddings are numerical representations of data, whether text, images, or sounds, in a high-dimensional space. For example, word embeddings represent words in a vector space where similar words are closer together. They are crucial for tasks like semantic search, where we need to find the most relevant documents based on their content. 
Some of the common Text Embedding models developers use in their AI applications are developed by OpenAI, Google, Cohere, Jina, and Mistral. Since we will be discussing and integrating Langchain into our module project, you can have a look at the list of embedding models available for use: [https://js.langchain.com/docs/integrations/text_embedding](https://js.langchain.com/docs/integrations/text_embedding).
- **Vector Databases**: These databases are designed to efficiently store and query embeddings and enable rapid similarity searches among large collections of embeddings, essential for the retrieval step in RAG. Some of the popular vector databases are [FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss) from Meta, [Chroma](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma), [HNSWLib](https://github.com/nmslib/hnswlib), [Memory](https://js.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/memory), and [Pinecone](https://github.com/pinecone-io/pinecone-ts-client). We will be using the last two for our module project. You can also take a look at the list of vector databases available for integration by Langchain: [https://js.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores](https://js.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores)

![image](https://github.com/thestriver/ai-for-javascript-course/assets/16709708/7df8c7b5-8a9d-46d1-bc83-a4fa88c765c4)

## Overview of Open-Source RAG Tools of the Trade

Several open-source tools have emerged to facilitate the development of RAG systems:

- **[Llama Index](https://github.com/run-llama/LlamaIndexTS)**: A data framework that facilitates the ingestion of data, storage, and retrieval of embeddings generated from your own data, making it easier to integrate LLMs into your applications with your own data.
- **[Embedchain](https://github.com/embedchain/embedchain/tree/main/embedchain-js)**: This RAG framework helps extract your data into relevant chunks and embeddings, making them useful in powering contextual responses to your queries.
- **[🦜️🔗](https://python.langchain.com/) [Langchain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain)**: A framework for setting up AI applications that can interact with external knowledge bases. It provides an ecosystem of integrations that allow you to ingest data, create and store embeddings, and set up optimized retrieval interfaces.

## Integrating Vercel AI SDK

To integrate the aforementioned models and tools into a JavaScript environment like Next.js, we will be using [Vercel’s open-source AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs) to streamline the AI development process.

## Implementing RAG in Next.js

Incorporating RAG into a Next.js application involves setting up the backend to handle RAG operations and creating frontend components to interact with this backend.

- **Frontend Integration**: Create UI components to take user documents and queries, communicate with the backend, and display the generated responses.
- **Backend Setup**: Implement the logic to retrieve data from the vector database and pass it to the RAG model for response generation.

## Module Project**: Building a Research Assistant Tool with Next.js and Langchain**

Imagine having a research assistant at your fingertips, one who can understand and provide insights from any PDF document you provide. This is not just a figment of imagination anymore; it's a reality we're going to build together using Next.js, Langchain, and vector databases like MemoryVectorStore and Pinecone.

### Our Tech Stack

For this project, we will be using Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, AI SDK, and Langchain. Additionally, we'll be exploring the use of vector databases by building a two-step research assistant tool, utilizing both MemoryVectorStore for one-time query retrieval and Pinecone for conversational chat retrieval. This dual approach leverages the strengths of each vector database to provide a comprehensive and versatile research tool.

### Prerequisites

Before we dive in, ensure you have Node installed on your machine. You'll also need an OpenAI API Key, which you can get from [OpenAI](https://openai.com/). 

### Setting Up Next.js

Start by creating a new Next.js project:

```jsx
npx create-next-app@latest research-assistant
```

Follow the CLI prompts to bootstrap your project. Opt for using the App Router, the **`src/`** directory, and choose to install Tailwind CSS too.

![image](https://github.com/thestriver/ai-for-javascript-course/assets/16709708/6006ec38-cd2a-46cf-95a4-c9bea4677229)

### Creating the **`.env.local`** File

In your project directory, create a **`.env.local`** file to store environment variables:

```jsx
OPENAI_API_KEY="openai_api_key"
```

### Installing Necessary Packages

Install the packages needed for our project:

```jsx
npm install langchain pdf-parse ai react-dropzone @pinecone-database/pinecone
```

### Step 1: One-Time Query Retrieval with MemoryVectorStore

In the first part of our application, we use MemoryVectorStore to handle one-time queries. This setup is ideal for quick document summarization and extracting key information from uploaded research papers.

### Crafting the **`/ingest-research`** Route

To begin building our research assistant tool, we need to create a route for ingesting research material, specifically PDF documents. This route, named **`/ingest-research`**, will be responsible for handling the upload of PDF files and processing them using Langchain to extract meaningful data that our AI can later utilize.

Start by creating a new file **`route.ts`** under the directory **`app/api/ingest-research`**. The code in this file will set up an API endpoint in our Next.js application, which will handle the uploading and processing of PDF files.

Here's a detailed look at the code for the **`/ingest-research`** route:

```jsx
import { PDFLoader } from "langchain/document_loaders/fs/pdf";
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next/server";
import { PineconeClient } from "@pinecone-database/pinecone";
import { OpenAIEmbeddings } from "langchain/embeddings/openai";
import { PineconeStore } from "langchain/vectorstores/pinecone";
import { RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter } from "langchain/text_splitter";

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  // Extract FormData from the request
  const data = await request.formData();
  // Extract the uploaded PDF file
  const file = data.get("file") as File;

  // Ensure a file is provided
  if (!file) {
    return NextResponse.json({ success: false, error: "No file provided" });
  }

  // Confirm the file is a PDF
  if (file.type !== "application/pdf") {
    return NextResponse.json({ success: false, error: "File is not a PDF" });
  }

  //Load the PDF and split it into smaller documents
  const pdfLoader = new PDFLoader(file);
	  const textSplitter = new RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter({
	  chunkSize: 1000,
	  chunkOverlap: 200,
	  });
  const splitDocuments = await pdfLoader.loadAndSplit(textSplitter);
	
// Create embeddings for the documents
  const embeddings = new OpenAIEmbeddings({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY });
  const vectorStore = await MemoryVectorStore.fromDocuments(splitDocuments, embeddings);

  // Set up the RAG model
  const model = new ChatOpenAI({ modelName: "gpt-3.5-turbo", openAIApiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY });
  const chain = RetrievalQAChain.fromLLM(model, vectorStore.asRetriever());

  // Generate a summary of the research document
  const response = await chain.call({
    query: "Summarize the primary arguments or findings in this research document, and format the output with likely questions as headers and answers as paragraphs in Markdown",
  });

  return NextResponse.json({ success: true, summary: response.text });
}
```

In this setup, the Langchain **`RetrievalQAChain`** uses the MemoryVectorStore for efficient retrieval of relevant document sections, which the **`ChatOpenAI`** model then summarizes.

<aside>
💡 The MemoryVectorStore is ephemeral, which is why we need to set up Pinecone for our next step.

</aside>

### Step 2: Conversational Chat Retrieval with Pinecone

The second part of our API route enhances the user experience by enabling a conversational chat interface with the documents. For this, we integrate Pinecone, a scalable vector database perfect for handling conversational context and maintaining state across queries.

### **Advantages of Pinecone for Conversational Retrieval**

- **Stateful Interactions**: Pinecone helps us maintain the context of a conversation, allowing the AI to provide coherent and consistent responses over a session.
- **Scalability**: It is designed to handle large-scale vector datasets efficiently, making it suitable for extensive research libraries.
- **Real-time Responses**: Pinecone's architecture ensures quick retrieval, essential for maintaining a fluid conversation.

### Signup for Pinecone

For this, sign up for a free-tier starter account at [Pinecone](https://pinecone.io/). Create an Index with the name of your choice (e.g., `research-assistant`) and set the Dimensions to 1536, aligning with OpenAI model requirements and the details to your `.env` file:

```jsx
PINECONE_API_KEY="pinecone_api_key"
PINECONE_INDEX_NAME="research-assistant"
```

Add the Pinecone setup as shown below after `// Create embeddings for the documents` line in the **`/ingest-research`** route. 

```jsx
// Initialize the Pinecone client
  const pineconeClient = new PineconeClient();
  await pineconeClient.init({
    apiKey: process.env.PINECONE_API_KEY ?? "",
    environment: "us-east-1-aws",
  });
  const index = pineconeClient.Index(process.env.PINECONE_INDEX_NAME);

  // Store the processed documents in Pinecone 
 await PineconeStore.fromDocuments(splitDocuments, new OpenAIEmbeddings(), {
    pineconeIndex,
    maxConcurrency: 5,
     namespace: filename,
     textKey: 'text'
    });
```

Here’s the link to the full version of the **`/ingest-research`** route.

### Building the **`/chat-research`** Route

The next step in our project is to create the **`/chat-research`** route. This endpoint will be the core of our research assistant, handling user queries by retrieving relevant information from our vector store and generating insightful responses using OpenAI models.

Create a new file **`route.ts`** under the directory **`app/api/chat-research`**. This file will contain the logic for processing user queries and interfacing with our AI model.

Here’s the full code for the **`/chat-research`** route:

```jsx
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next/server";
import { PineconeClient } from "@pinecone-database/pinecone";
import { PineconeStore } from "langchain/vectorstores/pinecone";
import { OpenAIEmbeddings } from "langchain/embeddings/openai";
import { OpenAI } from "langchain/llms/openai";
import { VectorDBQAChain } from "langchain/chains";
import { CallbackManager } from "langchain/callbacks";

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  // Parse the JSON body from the request
  const body = await request.json();

  // Initialize the Pinecone Client
  const pineconeClient = new PineconeClient();
  await pineconeClient.init({
    apiKey: process.env.PINECONE_API_KEY,
    environment: "us-east-1-aws",
  });
  const index = pineconeClient.Index(process.env.PINECONE_INDEX_NAME);

  // Prepare the vector store with the Pinecone index
  const vectorStore = new PineconeStore(new OpenAIEmbeddings(), { index });

  // Set up the OpenAI model
  const openAIModel = new OpenAI({
    modelName: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  });

  // Create a Langchain chain for Q&A
  const chain = new VectorDBQAChain(openAIModel, vectorStore);

  // Process the query and generate a response
  const response = await chain.call({ query: body.prompt });

  return NextResponse.json({ response });
}
```

### Building the Frontend

The success of our research assistant tool also depends on its user interface. It needs to be simple yet effective, allowing users to easily upload PDF documents and interact with the AI for queries. We will develop this interface using React, leveraging the capabilities of Next.js and integrating a file dropzone for PDF uploads and an input field for AI queries.

**Step 1: Setting Up the Metadata in `layout.tsx`**

Begin by updating the **`layout.tsx`** under the **`app/`** directory. This file will define the basic metadata for our application, setting the stage for a cohesive and informative UI. Here's a sample setup for your **`layout.tsx`**:

```jsx
export const metadata = {
  title: "AI-Powered Research Assistant",
  description: "Interact with your research documents through AI",
};
```

**Step 2: Building the Main Page Interface in `page.tsx`**

Now, let's focus on the main page of our application, **`page.tsx`**. This is where users will interact with the tool, upload documents, and ask questions.

Here’s a detailed code structure for the **`page.tsx`**:

```jsx
"use client";

import { useCallback } from "react";
import { useDropzone } from "react-dropzone";
import { useCompletion } from "ai/react";

export default function Home() {
  // When a file is dropped in the dropzone, call the `/api/ingest-research` API to train our bot on a new PDF File
  const onDrop = useCallback(async (acceptedFiles: File[]) => {
    const file = acceptedFiles[0];

    if (file.type !== "application/pdf") {
      alert("Please upload a PDF");
      return;
    }

    const formData = new FormData();
    formData.set("file", file);

		setUploading(true);

		try {
      const res = await fetch('/api/ingest-research', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: formData,
      });

      const result = await res.json();
      if (result.success) {
        alert('File uploaded successfully!');
      } else {
        alert('File upload failed!');
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error uploading file:', error);
      alert('An error occurred while uploading the file.');
    } finally {
      setUploading(false);
    }
  }, []);

  // Configure react-dropzone
  const { getRootProps, getInputProps } = useDropzone({
    onDrop,
  });

  // Vercel AI hook for generating completions through an AI model
  const { completion, input, isLoading, handleInputChange, handleSubmit } =
    useCompletion({
      api: "/api/chat-research",
    });

  return (
    <main className="flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center p-24">
      <h1>AI-Powered Research Assistant</h1>
      <div
        {...getRootProps({
          className:
            "dropzone bg-gray-900 border border-gray-800 p-10 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-800 transition-colors duration-200 ease-in-out cursor-pointer",
        })}
      >
        <input {...getInputProps()} />
        <p>Drag 'n' drop a PDF here, or click to select a file</p>
      </div>

      <div className="mx-auto w-full items-center max-w-md py-24 flex flex-col stretch">
        <form onSubmit={handleSubmit} className="flex flex-col gap-4">
          <input
            className=" w-full max-w-md text-black border border-gray-300 rounded shadow-xl p-2"
            value={input}
            placeholder="Ask a question..."
            onChange={handleInputChange}
          />

          <button
            disabled={isLoading}
            type="submit"
            className="py-2 border rounded-lg bg-gray-900 text-sm px-6"
          >
            Submit
          </button>

          <p className="text-center">
            Completion result: {completion === "" ? "Awaiting response..." : completion}
          </p>
        </form>
      </div>
    </main>
  );
}
```

In this setup:

- We use **`react-dropzone`** to create a drag-and-drop area for uploading PDFs.
- The **`onDrop`** function handles the logic for uploading files to the **`/ingest-research`** endpoint.
- The **`handleSubmit`** function sends user queries to the **`/chat-research`** endpoint and displays the AI's response.
- Styling can be adjusted as per your design preference using CSS or a framework like Tailwind CSS.

### Running the Application

To test your application, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Upload the research documents of your choice (in PDF format), and once the training is complete, you can start querying the AI with prompts related to the uploaded content.

## Conclusion

You've successfully built a full-stack RAG setup capable of learning and chatting with any research document it's trained on. This tool stands as a testament to the power of combining AI with modern web development.

As you explore further, think about how this technology can be expanded. How can you utilize AI to enhance the way we interact with and learn from vast amounts of textual data?

# **Module 5: Building Complex AI Applications**

In the ever-evolving landscape of AI, the ability to construct complex applications stands as a hallmark of advanced development skills. In this module, we dive deep into the intricacies of advanced AI topics like temperature control, AI function calling, and the creation of AI agents. Going beyond basic interactions, this section explores how to extend AI models for specialized functions and create autonomous AI agents. This module will not only enhance your understanding but also equip you with the tools to build sophisticated AI-driven applications.

## Advanced Prompt Engineering and Optimization

The foundation of any sophisticated AI interaction lies in its prompt engineering. A well-crafted prompt can steer generative AI models in the desired direction, significantly impacting the quality and relevance of their responses.

- **The Essence of Prompt Design**: Crafting effective prompts involves a keen understanding of the AI's language model. For instance, GPTs respond differently based on the nuances of the prompt given. According to a study by OpenAI, tweaking just a few words in a prompt can lead to markedly different outputs.
- **Temperature Control for Creativity and Precision**: The concept of 'temperature' in AI controls the randomness of the generated responses. A lower temperature yields more predictable and conservative outputs, whereas a higher temperature can generate more creative and diverse responses. This feature allows developers to tailor the AI's responses to suit the needs of their application, whether it be a creative storytelling assistant or a factual information retriever.

## AI Function Calling

Modern AI models, such as those offered by OpenAI, can perform an array of functions – from translating languages to generating code. These models can self-invoke functions provided and carry out specific tasks like summarization, translation, or even code generation.

Supported by GPT 3.5-turbo and GPT 4 models, the function calling feature is a nice way for developers like you to describe a set of defined functions that the models can intelligently use to connect to external data points, thereby enhancing their responses.

## **Crafting AI Agents**

An AI agent is an autonomous entity capable of performing tasks, interacting, and learning. Creating an AI agent involves not only technical prowess but also an understanding of user experience and interaction dynamics. Experts believe that AI agents are rapidly evolving and finding their place in various industries, from customer service to personal assistants.

        gl: "fr",
      }),
    ];
    
    const vectorStore = new HNSWLib(new OpenAIEmbeddings());
    const autogpt = AutoGPT.fromLLMAndTools(
      new ChatOpenAI({ temperature: 0 }),
      tools,
      {
        memory: vectorStore.asRetriever(),
        aiName: "Foobar",
        aiRole: "Assistant",
      }
    );
    
    async function runEnhancedAgent() {
      const response = await autogpt.run(["Generate an enriched culinary tour itinerary in Paris"]);
      console.log("Enhanced Culinary Tour Itinerary in Paris:", response);
    }
    
    runEnhancedAgent();
    ```
    

### Project 3: ****Building a Location-Based Suggestion Agent with OpenAI SDK and Node.js****

In this tutorial, we'll create a Node.js application that uses OpenAI's function-calling capability to suggest activities or foods based on the user's location. Our app will be simple: it will determine the user's location and then generate suggestions accordingly.

**Setting Up Your Project**

1. **Initialize a Node.js Project**:
    - Create a new directory for your project and run **`npm init -y`** to initialize a Node.js project.
    - Install the necessary packages: **`npm install openai node-fetch dotenv`**.
2. **Setting Up Environment Variables**:
    - In your project directory, create a file named **`.env`**.
    - Add your OpenAI API key: **`OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here`**.

**Building the Application**

1. **Fetch Location and Set Up OpenAI**
- The **`fetchUserLocation`** function retrieves the user's location based on their IP address.
- **Setting Up OpenAI**: We configure the OpenAI SDK with the API key and define the tools (functions) that the AI can suggest calling.
    
    ```jsx
    import OpenAI from "openai";
    import dotenv from 'dotenv';
    dotenv.config();
     
    const openAI = new OpenAI({
      apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
      dangerouslyAllowBrowser: true,
    });
    
    async function fetchUserLocation() {
      const locationResponse = await fetch("https://ipapi.co/json/");
      return await locationResponse.json();
    }
    
    const aiTools = [
      {
        type: "function",
        function: {
          name: "fetchUserLocation",
          description: "Determines user location based on IP",
          parameters: {
            type: "object",
            properties: {},
          },
        },
      },
    ];
    
    const toolset = {
      fetchUserLocation,
    };
    ```
    
1. **Creating the Agent Function and Generating Suggestions**
- The **`agent`** function is where the magic happens. It communicates with OpenAI to get suggestions on which function to call and then executes the suggested function.
    
    ```jsx
    async function agent(inputText) {
      let chatHistory = [
        {
          role: "system",
          content: `You are a smart assistant. Use the provided tools effectively.`,
        },
        {
          role: "user",
          content: inputText,
        },
      ];
    
      for (let attempt = 0; attempt < 5; attempt++) {
        const aiResponse = await openai.chat.completions.create({
          model: "gpt-4",
          messages: chatHistory,
          tools: aiTools,
        });
    
        const { finish_reason, message } = aiResponse.choices[0];
    
        if (finish_reason === "tool_calls" && message.tool_calls) {
          const functionName = message.tool_calls[0].function.name;
          const calledFunction = toolset[functionName];
          const functionArgs = JSON.parse(message.tool_calls[0].function.arguments);
          const functionArgsArr = Object.values(functionArgs);
          const functionResponse = await calledFunction.apply(
            null,
            functionArgsArr,
          );
    
          chatHistory.push({
            role: "function",
            name: functionName,
            content: `
                      The result of the last function was this: ${JSON.stringify(
                        functionResponse,
                      )}
                      `,
          });
        } else if (finish_reason === "stop") {
          chatHistory.push(message);
          return message.content;
        }
      }
      return "No conclusive suggestion could be generated. Please refine your query.";
    }
    ```
    
1. **Running Your Application**:
    
    To run your application:
    
- **Start the Application**: Use **`node yourfilename.js`** in your terminal.
- **Interact with the AI**: The script will execute, and you should see food suggestions based on the detected location in your console.
    
    ```jsx
    async function main() {
      const userQuery =
        "Could you suggest some local delicacies based on where I am?";
      const suggestion = await agent(userQuery);
      console.log("Suggestion:", suggestion);
    }
    
    main();
    ```
    

By following these steps, you've just created an intelligent agent capable of making function calls to provide real-world information and suggestions. This agent exemplifies how AI can be leveraged to create interactive and dynamic applications.

- **Full code**
    
    ```jsx
    
    import OpenAI from "openai";
    import dotenv from 'dotenv';
    dotenv.config();
     
    const openAI = new OpenAI({
      apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
      dangerouslyAllowBrowser: true,
    });
    
    async function fetchUserLocation() {
      const locationResponse = await fetch("https://ipapi.co/json/");
      const locationData = await locationResponse.json();
      return locationData;
    }
    
    const aiTools = [
      {
        type: "function",
        function: {
          name: "fetchUserLocation",
          description: "Determines user location based on IP",

        {
          role: "user",
          content: inputText,
        },
      ];
    
      for (let attempt = 0; attempt < 5; attempt++) {
        const aiResponse = await openai.chat.completions.create({
          model: "gpt-4",
          messages: chatHistory,
          tools: aiTools,
        });
    
        const { finish_reason, message } = aiResponse.choices[0];
    
        if (finish_reason === "tool_calls" && message.tool_calls) {
          const functionName = message.tool_calls[0].function.name;
          const calledFunction = toolset[functionName];
          const functionArgs = JSON.parse(message.tool_calls[0].function.arguments);
          const functionArgsArr = Object.values(functionArgs);
          const functionResponse = await calledFunction.apply(
            null,
            functionArgsArr,
          );
    
          chatHistory.push({
            role: "function",
            name: functionName,
            content: `
                      The result of the last function was this: ${JSON.stringify(
                        functionResponse,
                      )}
                      `,
          });
        } else if (finish_reason === "stop") {
          chatHistory.push(message);
          return message.content;
        }
      }
      return "No conclusive suggestion could be generated. Please refine your query.";
    }
    
    async function main() {
      const userQuery =
        "Could you suggest some local delicacies based on where I am?";
      const suggestion = await agent(userQuery);
      console.log("Suggestion:", suggestion);
    }
    
    main();
    ```
